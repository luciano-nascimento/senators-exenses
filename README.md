# Senators' Expenses   

### Motivation

It was created with studies purposes during IGTI Frontend Bootcamp, it's a challenge using Angular technology where the senators' expenses must be shown using mocked API.  

### Running application

first you must run the mocked api (after install json-server using npm/yarn)

```sh
$ json-server --watch despesas.json 
```

then run the angular app

```sh
$ ng serve
```
